	<p>Ghattamaneni Mahesh Babu was born on 9 August 1975 in a Telugu family in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India. He is the fourth of the five children of Telugu actor Krishna and Indira, after Ramesh Babu, Padmavathi, and Manjula and before Priyadarshini. Their family hails from Burripalem in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. Babu spent his childhood mostly in Madras under the care of his maternal grandmother Durgamma and the rest of his family.Since Krishna was busy with his film commitments, Ramesh Babu used to look after Mahesh Babu's academic performance. Along with his siblings, Babu used to play cricket regularly at the VGP Golden beach in Madras. To spend time with him, Krishna used to make sure that his films' shoots would be conducted at the VGP Universal Kingdom during the weekends.

Krishna also made sure that none of his children would reveal his name during their schooling to ensure a peaceful environment. He was educated at St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai where actor Karthi was his schoolmate. Babu in an interview said that actor Vijay and he have been longtime close friends and studied at the same college, before establishing themselves in their respective film industries. Babu was an above average student. He obtained a bachelor's degree in commerce from the Loyola College, Chennai. After graduating, he met with director L. Satyanand in Vishakhapatnam for further training in acting which went on for three to four months. Being unable to read and write Telugu, he used to memorise the dialogues given by his directors during the dubbing phase of his films.</p>

	<p>Early career and breakthrough (1979–2003)
At the age of four, Babu visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh. Needa marked his debut as a child actor.[21] During the shoot of Poratam (1983) at Vauhini Studios, after watching Babu on the sets, director Kodi Ramakrishna suggested to Krishna that he cast Babu in the role of the protagonist's brother. Initially terrified, Babu agreed to act in the film after being persuaded by the film's crew.[21] He went on to act as a child artist in the films Sankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the film Koduku Diddina Kapuram (1989). Babu then appeared in Bala Chandrudu (1990), and Anna Thammudu (1990). Later, he continued his college studies.[22]

In 1999, Babu made his debut as a lead actor with the film Raja Kumarudu, directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and co-starring Priety Zinta. The film was commercially successful, and people began referring to him with the title Prince.[23] The film had a 50-day run in 80 centres and a 100-day run in 44 centres. Raja Kumarudu collected a share of ₹10.51 Crores from Andhra Pradesh.[24] It was dubbed in Hindi as Prince No. 1 and in Tamil as Kaadhal Vennila.[25] The film was again dubbed and released theatrically in Tamil during January 2017 as Ivan Oru Thunichalkaran.[26] He received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[27] He starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi. Following their poor performance at the box office, Babu starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari the next year. He called Murari an important film in his career and the role he played in it one of his favourites.[28][29] Murari was a commercial success and earned him the Nandi Special Jury Award.[27] Though his 2002 releases Takkari Donga and Bobby performed poorly at the box office, Babu received his second Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in the former.[27]

Babu had two film releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu co-starring Bhumika Chawla, which went on to become the highest grossing Telugu film of the year collecting ₹23 crores at the box office.[30] He won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[31] The other release was Teja's Nijam co-starring Rakshita. The film was noted for introducing Dolby EX surround system in Telugu cinema.[32] Though the film was a commercial failure,[33] Babu received praise from the critics for his performance in the film, with Vijayalaxmi of Rediff.com calling him the only reason to watch the film's second half which she termed a routine tale of vendetta.[34] He won his first Nandi Best Actor Award for his performance in the film.[35]</p>

	<p>Babu is considered one of the most popular actors in Telugu cinema.[125] He is widely referred in the media as "Superstar of Tollywood"[126] and "Prince Mahesh Babu".[127] Hemanth Kumar C. R. of Vogue felt that Murari (2001), Okkadu (2003), Athadu (2005), Pokiri (2006), Khaleja (2010), Dookudu (2011), 1: Nenokkadine (2014), Srimanthudu (2015) and Bharat Ane Nenu (2018) are the films that made Mahesh Babu, a superstar in the film industry.[128]

His popularity has been documented in several Telugu films such as Ashta Chamma (2008),[129] Kiraak (2014),[130] and Superstar Kidnap (2015).[131] He joined Twitter in April 2010 and has 12 million followers as of July 2021.[132]

He was ranked twelfth on the Times' 50 Most Desirable Men in India for the year 2010,[133] fifth in 2011,[134] and second in 2012.[135] He climbed to the first position of the same list for the year 2013, beating the likes of Hrithik Roshan, Salman Khan, and Shah Rukh Khan.[136] He stood at sixth place on the same list for the year 2014,[137] sixth in 2015,[138] seventh in 2016,[139] and sixth in 2017.[140] He was then added to the Forever Desirable list along with Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar, and Hrithik Roshan.[141]

Babu is an ambassador for about three dozen Indian brands.[142][143] In 2007, he signed a five-year endorsement deal with the cola company Thums Up to replace Chiranjeevi as its brand ambassador in Andhra Pradesh.[144] He endorsed brands such as UniverCell Mobile Store,[145] Navratna Oil,[146] Amrutanjan,[147] Provogue,[148] ITC Vivel,[149] Jos Alukkas,[150] Idea Cellular,[151] Santoor Soap,[152] South India Shopping Mall,[153] Royal Stag,[154] Rainbow Hospitals,[155] TVS Motor Company,[156] Mahindra Tractors,[157] Paragon footwear, and[158] Tata Sky in South India.[159] He was signed as the brand ambassador of Intex Mobiles in August 2015 for one year.[160] In 2012, he replaced Akshay Kumar as the national brand ambassador for Thums Up across India.[161] He also promotes the real estate firm Ramakrishna Venuzia.[162] Babu commands a figure of ₹2.5–3 crore per endorsement per annum, thus earning around ₹30 crore per annum as a brand ambassador.[163] In 2016, he was signed as the brand ambassador of YuppTV[164] and AbhiBus.[165] In February 2018 he was signed as the brand ambassador for Protinex.[166] Some of the other brands he endorses, or had endorsed previously, include Chennai Silks,[167] Sai Surya Developers,[168] Close-Up,[169] Gold Winner,[170] Denver Deodorant,[171] Lloyd AC,[172] Flipkart,[173] Helo app,[174][175] Byju's,[176] CarDekho,[177] Jeep India,[178][179] Whitehat Junior,[180] Lloyd Refrigerators,[181] Jeevan Saathi,[182] Health OK Tablets,[183] Big C Mobiles,[184] Pan Bahar Elaichi,[185] and Mountain Dew.[186] Overall, he has endorsed 39 brands thus far. He has also shot a unique concept video for Zee Telugu to promote their upcoming TV shows.[187] In 2022, Mahesh Babu ended his association with Thums Up.[188] The same year, he faced criticism for endorsing the brand Pan Bahar Elaichi, after the statement–"Bollywood cannot afford me" he made during a promotional event of Major.[189]

Babu has also supported AIG Hospitals' "End Corona Campaign", which was aimed at creating awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine.[190] It was one of the world's largest virtual awareness campaigns on the COVID-19 vaccine.[191]

Babu stood in 31st place on Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list for the year 2012, with annual earnings of ₹42.25 crore.[192] He slipped to 54th place on the same list for the year 2013, with his annual earnings dropping to ₹28.96 crore.[193] In the following year, he climbed to the 30th position with an annual earning figure of ₹51 crore.[194] In 2015, he placed 36th, the highest ranking Telugu celebrity, with an income of ₹51 crore.[195] He was placed 37th, 33rd and 54th consecutively in the years leading up to 2019 with an annual earning of ₹35 crore.[196] Babu was once criticized for his limited and predictable wardrobe when attending events.[197]

In 2019, his wax statue was unveiled in Madame Tussauds Singapore.[198] Hindustan Times reported that Babu was the first Telugu actor to get a wax statue at Madame Tussauds, while Baahubali (portrayed by Prabhas) was the first Telugu film character.[199] He was also the first Indian actor whose wax statue was flown back for a day for unveiling at his hometown.[200]</p>

	<p>Family
During the shoot of B. Gopal's Vamsi at Australia, Babu began to date his co-star Namrata Shirodkar. After being in a relationship for four years, they decided to get married, and Manjula convinced Krishna in favour of their decision.[19] They were married on 10 February 2005 at the Marriott Hotel, Mumbai during the shooting of Athadu.[201] The couple's first child was born on 31 August 2006 at the Global Hospital in Hyderabad.[202] The boy, named Gautham Krishna, was a premature baby and was in critical condition during his birth. His condition turned stable after the doctors treated him in time.[92] On 20 July 2012, Shirodkar gave birth to a girl whom they named Sitara.[203] Before her delivery, they preserved her stem cells using stem cell banking to ensure a better immunity level.[204]

Babu is the fourth child in a family of five children. His elder brother Ramesh Babu was a film producer and was also an actor. Mahesh Babu's eldest sister Padmavathi is married to Galla Jayadev, an industrialist and Member of the Indian Parliament from the Telugu Desam Party.[205] His elder sister Manjula is a film producer, director, and an actress.[citation needed] Priyadarshini, his younger sister, is married to Sudheer Babu, who later made his debut as an actor in Telugu cinema.[206]

Telugu actress and filmmaker Vijaya Nirmala was Babu's step-mother, and actor Naresh is his step-brother.[207]

Philanthropy
Babu gives 30% of his annual income to charities, and most of his philanthropic activities are unpublicised because he prefers them to be so.[208] He joined Farhan Akhtar's Men Against Rape and Discrimination (MARD) campaign in August 2013 and lent his voice to the Telugu version of a poem written by Javed Akhtar.[209] He was signed in 2013 as the goodwill ambassador of Heal-a-child Foundation, a non-profit organisation that offers financial support to the parents of terminally ill children to help with the cost of medical treatment.[210] In October 2014, he donated ₹25 lakh to a relief fund run by the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh for reconstruction of areas destroyed during Cyclone Hudhud. Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala later donated ₹25 lakh to the fund.[211]

Jayadev announced in February 2015 that Babu would adopt Krishna's native village Burripalem, a minor panchayat in Tenali, and would address basic needs of the community such as potable drinking water and better roads and drainage systems.[212] Babu also announced that he is working with Telangana's Rural Development minister K. T. Rama Rao to adopt another village in Mahbubnagar district.[213]

Legal issues
In September 2004, Babu and director Gunasekhar attended a rally organised by his fans at Warangal for the promotional activities of Arjun. He and his fans allegedly raided two video libraries and assaulted their owners who were circulating unauthorised CDs of the film. Cases under IPC section 448 (criminal trespass), section 427 (mischief) and section 366 (kidnap) were registered on him, who was the principal accused, and five others.[214] Later, a delegation from the Telugu film industry, including his father Krishna, Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Allu Aravind and D. Suresh Babu, approached the then chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy to intervene in this case. Regarding the issue, Babu said that while cases were booked against him on "the basis of wrong information," not a single case had been booked against the person dealing in bootlegged CDs, which he found the "funniest" thing.[215] Actor Pawan Kalyan openly supported Babu throughout the episode.[216] Babu surrendered in the district court in September 2004 and appeared before the court again in April 2006. Babu and the others were exonerated after the final hearing in July 2006</p>
